1.	Stereo Vision Setup: Use two webcams for stereo vision to estimate depth. For higher performance, integrate a Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson for faster processing.
2.	Object Detection: Implement YOLO or SSD for detecting objects in real time.
3.	Object Tracking: Use DeepSORT, ByteTrack, or OC-SORT to track objects continuously.
4.	Enhanced Depth Accuracy: Apply image segmentation within bounding boxes to improve depth estimation.
5.	Depth Estimation: Use stereo vision or advanced methods like RGB-D SLAM (costlier but more accurate) or monocular depth estimation.
6.	3D Object Placement: Leverage depth data to place detected objects in a 3D scene using X, Y, Z coordinates based on bounding boxes.
7.	3D Visualization: Visualize the 3D model using rendering tools such as OpenGL, Blender, or PCL. Explore real-time model updates if algorithms are fast enough.
8.	Path Planning: Utilize SLAM to map the environment and localize the systemâ€™s position for navigation.
9.	Object Recognition for Hazards: Detect common objects like stairs using YOLO, alerting the user of potential obstacles.
10.	Zone Management with Depth Info: Define zones using depth information and alert when objects cross certain thresholds.
11.	Text-to-Speech Alerts: Use text-to-speech functionality to provide real-time verbal alerts.
12.	Indoor Navigation: Adapt the system for users with cataracts or blurry vision to help them navigate indoor spaces.
13.	Customized Object Recognition: Customize object detection and recognition based on specific user needs, enhancing usability.
14.	Lightweight Models & Accelerators: Deploy lightweight versions of models to run in real time on Raspberry Pi, leveraging hardware accelerators like Google Coral USB Accelerator for improved performance.
15.	Edge and Fog Computing: Explore using edge and fog computing for processing in crowded environments, ensuring better scalability.
16.	GPS Integration: Optionally integrate GPS for map-based navigation assistance.
